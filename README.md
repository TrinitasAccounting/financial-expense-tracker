Financial Expense Tracker

# Introduction
This is a personal finance tracker. Currently you have to input your expenses manually, unfortunately. Input transactions using the form and select the category you would like. The dashboard page will update accordingly and show current financial position. 


# Future Updates
In future I would like to add that this can pull straight from a bank accounts API or from a business accounting software. I would also like for the user to be able to change the category after the expense has been added to the system.
